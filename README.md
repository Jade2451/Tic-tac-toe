# Tic-tac-toe
A simple tic-tac-toe game using Python GUI.

## Motivation:
While trying to wrap my head around complicated concepts which are nevertheless important for their influence in data science projects, I tried to start simple. This is a project where I ended up making a tic-tac-toe game by simply using python, complete with a GUI and full user interactibility. 

## Setup and Usage:

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Jade2451/Tic-tac-toe]
cd [MoE_CIFAR10]
```

**2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
